Installation instructions for running slideshow on Debian 11 XFCE

Install latest Debian and boot device

Update packages
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

Install the following applications:

matchbox window manager - light weight window manager
sudo apt install matchbox

rsync - file synchronisation application
sudo apt install rsync

libreoffice - office suite including presentation application
sudo apt install libreoffice

Edit lightdm configuration to set auto login by editing /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
under the [Seat:*] section.
In this example the default user is rock:
[Seat:*]
...
#session-cleanup-script=                                                        
autologin-guest=false                                                           
autologin-user=rock                                                             
autologin-user-timeout=0                                                        
#autologin-in-background=false

Setup auto mount for USB drive
Obtain UUID for your drive by plugging it in and running:
sudo blkid

Then add an entry into /etc/fstab for example:
UUID=ABCD-1234  /mnt/usbdrive  vfat  noauto,nofail,x-systemd.automount,x-systemd.idle-timeout=2,x-systemd.device-timeout=2

noauto - No mount with mount -a
nofail - Continue booting even mount point fails
x-systemd.automount - Automount this UUID
x-systemd.idle-timeout=2 - Wait 2 seconds before unmounting
x-systemd.device-timeout=2 - Timeout after 2 seconds


Copy .xsession to /home/${USER} - This script starts the display manager and syncs the default
users home with a fresh copy from /opt/${USER} - this is what stops anyone breaking in.

Create a copy of the default user ${USER} in /opt
sudo cp -r /home/${USER} /opt/

Create a directory in the root of your USB drive named slideshow - this must contain an odp format
file called slideshow.odp and any audio / video files that are embeded in it. This whole dir is
coppied to the users home on startup 

Restart your device and stand back and enjoy your show


Note
The slideshow starts on boot and enters a loop so no one can break in. If you need to access the filesystem
the easiest way is to make sure the serial console is enabled and do it via that.

The system is not designed to be attached to the network in this configuration due to the auto login.
